I have always wanted a centralized place to store and display all my projects, discoveries, and stories. 
I know for a fact that I needed a static website to do this. However, I wasn't too keen on writing all the HTML and CSS myself, it felt tedious.I also didn't want to mess with all the JavaScript frontend libraries, as they are way too overkill and time consuming to learn. 

I stumbled upon the concept of a "static site generator" recently, and it blew my mind how well it fits my need - I just need to provide the content, and it will generate all the files needed for hosting the website! How neat!

I settled on this specific site generator called "Hugo", which is what I used to build this blog. It reads content written in Markdown (which is a lot easier then writing HTML and CSS) and generate the entire website according to a predefined template, which Hugo calls a "theme". It also claims to be the fastest site generator, a nice little bonus.

Now that I have the platform, I will start posting some of my past projects onto here, so stay tuned!
