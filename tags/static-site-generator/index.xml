I know for a fact that I needed a static website to do this. However, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too keen on writing all the HTML and CSS myself, it felt tedious.I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess with all the JavaScript frontend libraries, as they are way too overkill and time consuming to learn.
I stumbled upon the concept of a &amp;ldquo;static site generator&amp;rdquo; recently, and it blew my mind how well it fits my need - I just need to provide the content, and it will generate all the files needed for hosting the website!</description></item></channel></rss>
