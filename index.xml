I know for a fact that I needed a static website to do this. However, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too keen on writing all the HTML and CSS myself, it felt tedious.I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess with all the JavaScript frontend libraries, as they are way too overkill and time consuming to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stumbled upon the concept of a &amp;ldquo;static site generator&amp;rdquo; recently, and it blew my mind how well it fits my need - I just need to provide the content, and it will generate all the files needed for hosting the website! How neat!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I settled on this specific site generator called &amp;ldquo;Hugo&amp;rdquo;, which is what I used to build this blog. It reads content written in Markdown (which is a lot easier then writing HTML and CSS) and generate the entire website according to a predefined template, which Hugo calls a &amp;ldquo;theme&amp;rdquo;. It also claims to be the fastest site generator, a nice little bonus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have the platform, I will start posting some of my past projects onto here, so stay tuned!&lt;/p>
